I built and deployed an eCommerce site using the **MERN** stack. The site has features such as user accounts, login security, shopping baskets, orders, profiles, checkout, PayPal gateways, and administrator privileges. The site is secure and uses a variety of server and client-side security measures to protect user data. The site is also responsive and can be viewed on any device.

## Features

<ul>
  <li>Built an eCommerce site using the MERN stack and other helper packages, such as Redux, MongoDB Compass, and Object data mapping.</li>
  <li>Used JWT token-based authentication and password hashing to secure the site.</li>
  <li>Developed API endpoints for front-end communication.</li>
  <li>Created a responsive design with a great-looking UI using Chakra UI.</li>
  <li>Used Formik and Yup for form validation.</li>
  <li>Created reusable form components.</li>
  <li>Handled errors via Yup validators in the frontend and middleware and controllers in the backend.</li>
  <li>Created orders from the shopping basket.</li>
  <li>Accepted payments via PayPal.</li>
  <li>Used a Git repository for version control.</li>
  <li>Deployed the site with Render.</li>
  <li>Created dynamic pages for mobile and larger screens.</li>
</ul>


## Installation

Make sure to install packages at the root level and in the client level.

`npm install`

Make sure at your root level you have a .env file to hold your environment variables.

Five environmental variables are required.

``` MONGO_URI (This will hold your MongoDB connection string. Make sure that where it states <password> that you place your password without the <>)
NODE_ENV=production
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID (This requires you access your API within your PayPal developer account)
PORT=5000
TOKEN_SECRET (Can be anything random. This is your JWT secret key) 
```
